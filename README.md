Health Care Robot â€“ Robotics Project ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡
Welcome to the Health Care Robot project! This Arduino-based robot is designed to assist both patients and medical staff with automation and safety features. Developed for my Robotics Module, this project demonstrates key functionalities such as automatic water dispensing, gas detection, and more.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Automatic Water Dispensing â€“ The robot can provide water to patients upon request using a water dispensing mechanism.

âœ… Gas Detection & Alarm â€“ A gas sensor detects harmful gases in the environment and raises an alarm when necessary.

âœ… Heart Rate Monitoring â€“ The robot continuously monitors a patient's heart rate in real-time using a heart rate sensor.

âœ… Line Following Navigation â€“ The robot can follow a predefined path to deliver medicine or other supplies to a specified location.

âœ… Obstacle Detection & Stop â€“ The robot automatically stops when it detects an obstacle in its path, preventing potential collisions.

ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used:
Arduino â€“ Microcontroller for controlling robot operations.

Sensors â€“ Gas sensor, heart rate sensor, and obstacle detection sensors.

Motors â€“ For movement and line-following navigation.

IoT â€“ (Optional) Future integration for remote monitoring and alerts.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements:
AI Integration â€“ Introduce machine learning models for improved decision-making (e.g., obstacle avoidance).

Voice Commands â€“ Voice-based control for better interaction with patients and medical staff.

Cloud Integration â€“ Sync data with the cloud for remote health monitoring and alerts.
