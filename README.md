Health Care Robot â€“ Robotics Project ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡
Excited to share my latest Arduino-based Health Care Robot, developed for my Robotics module. This project is designed to assist patients and medical staff with automation and safety features.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Automatic Water Dispensing â€“ Provides water to patients on request.

âœ… Gas Detection & Alarm â€“ Alerts when harmful gases are detected.

âœ… Heart Rate Monitoring â€“ Measures the patientâ€™s heartbeat in real-time.

âœ… Line Following Navigation â€“ Delivers medicines to the destination.

âœ… Obstacle Detection & Stop â€“ Automatically stops when an obstacle is detected.
